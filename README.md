Bird Species Classification Using Deep Learning
Birds exhibit a wide range of sizes, shapes, colors, and orientations. Classifying bird species from images is particularly challenging due to the high diversity of colors and patterns, as well as the visual similarities between species. This study applied deep learning models for bird species classification and compared their performance using the BIRDS 525 SPECIES dataset.

Objective
The objective of this study is to classify bird species from images using deep learning techniques.

Methodology
This study compared the ResNet50 and InceptionV3 deep learning models. The BIRDS 525 SPECIES dataset, consisting of 84,635 training images, 2,625 test images, and 2,625 validation images, was used. Each image is 224 x 224 pixels in size.

Results
InceptionV3 achieved an accuracy of 89.94%, while ResNet50 achieved 21% accuracy. The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. InceptionV3 outperformed ResNet50 in all metrics.

Conclusion
InceptionV3 demonstrated superior performance over ResNet50 in the task of bird species classification. Future work will focus on improving these models and exploring new architectures for better performance.
